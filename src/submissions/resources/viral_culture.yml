# The defaults section helps us with some parsing and writing functions
defaults:
#    The abbreviation gets put in the RSL-{abbreviation}-20XXXXXX-1 plate name
    abbreviation: &ABBREV VE
#    Details ignore tells us what to leave out of the details view.
#    For basic submissions this is typically and empty list or '[]'
#    To add entries, remove [] and add list entries preceded by dashes (see 'form_ignore' as an example)
    details_ignore: []
#    Form ignore tells us what to leave out of the form created when importing the submission.
#    It is in list format. Each entry is preceded by a dash.

    #    The regex is used to identify a submission type by its file name, example: RSL-WW-20240924-1R1
    #    By default the regex will be programmatically constructed using the submission type name and abbreviation
    #    https://stackoverflow.com/a/23212501
    regex: !regex [*NAME, *ABBREV]
# The info section holds a map of where submission info can be located  in the submission form.
# For example, below the 'comment' field is found on the 'Sample List' tab in column 2 of tow 34.
# 'read' is a list of where the info can be parsed from, write is a list of where it will be written to.
# By default, items in the 'read' list will be appended to the 'write' list.
# These fields are common to all submissions. Without programming changes, at present no new fields can be added.
