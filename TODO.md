- [x] Rerun Kit integrity if extraction kit changed in the form.
- [x] Clean up db.functions.
- [ ] Make kits easier to add.
- [ ] Clean up & document code... again.
    - Including paring down the logging.debugs
    - Also including reducing number of functions in db.functions
- [x] Fix Tests... again.
- [x] Rebuild database
- [x] Provide more generic names for reagenttypes in kits and move specific names to reagents.
    - ex. Instead of "omega_e-z_96_disruptor_plate_c_plus" in reagent types, have "omega_plate" and have "omega_e-z_96_disruptor_plate_c_plus" in reagent name.
    - Maybe rename to "ReagentRoles"?
    - If I'm doing this, since the forms have a different layout for each submission type I should rewrite the parser to use the locations given in database... Which I should do anyway
- [x] Fix Wastewater/Artic double submission problem
- [x] Fix tests.
- [x] Reorganize wastewater artic parser.
- [x] Streamline addition of new kits by moving as much into DB as possible.
- [x] Large scale refactor (2023-07-24).
- [x] Make plate details from html, same as export.
- [x] Put in SN controls I guess.
- [x] Code clean-up and refactor (2023-07).
- [x] Migrate context settings to pydantic-settings model.
- [x] Insert column into reagent type to indicate if reagent is required for kit.
    - Needed to keep interchangeable bead plates from being forced into forms.
- [x] Migrate the parser.sub dictionary to pydantic models.
- [x] Move type_decider to metadata based method rather than excel map.
- [x] Solve bug for plate mapping when two samples of same name are in different rows.
    - Try importing "L:\Robotics Laboratory Support\Submissions\Wastewater\2023\2023-06-21\RSL-WW-20230621-1.xlsx" for example.
- [x] Improve plate mapping by using layout in submission forms rather than PCR.
- [x] Create a method for creation of hitpicking .csvs because of reasons that may or may not exist.
- [x] Create a method for commenting submissions.
- [x] Create barcode generator, because of reasons that may or may not exist.
- [x] Move bulk of functions from frontend.__init__ to frontend.functions as __init__ is getting bloated.
