- [ ] Create Tips ... *sigh*.
- [x] Create platemap image from html for export to pdf.
- [x] Move plate map maker to submission.
- [x] Finish Equipment Parser (add in regex to id asset_number)
- [ ] Complete info_map in the SubmissionTypeCreator widget.
- [x] Update Artic and add in equipment listings... *sigh*.
- [x] Fix WastewaterAssociations not in Session error.
    - Done... I think?
- [x] Fix submitted date always being today.
    - this is an issue with the way client is filling in form with =TODAY()
- [x] SubmissionReagentAssociation.query 
- [x] Move as much from db.functions to objects as possible.
- [x] Clean up DB objects after failed test fix.
- [x] Fix tests.
- [x] Fix pydant.PydSample.handle_duplicate_samples?
- [x] See if the number of queries in BasicSubmission functions (and others) can be trimmed down.
- [x] Document code 
- [x] Create a result object to facilitate returning function results.
- [x] Refactor main_window_functions into as many objects (forms, etc.) as possible to clean it up.
- [x] Integrate 'Construct First Strand' into the Artic import.
- [x] Clear out any unnecessary ctx passes now that queries are improved.
- [x] Make a 'query or create' method in all db objects to go with new query.
    - Due to necessity of user input this has only been implemented for BasicSubmission, BasicSample and SubmissionSampleAssociation.
- [x] Ensure Bacterial plates end up with RSL_YY_###_{submitterName}_{submitterPlateID}.xlsx format.
- [x] Move lookup functions into class methods of db objects?
    - Not sure if will work for associations.
- [x] Update artic submission type database entry to add more technicians.
- [x] Rewrite tests... again.
- [x] Have InfoItem change status self.missing to True if value changed.
- [x] Make the kit verifier make more sense.
- [x] Slim down the Import and Submit functions in main_window_functions.
- [x] Create custom store methods for submission, reagent and sample.
- [x] Make pydantic models for other things that use constructors.
- [x] Move backend.db.functions.constructor functions into Pydantic models.
    - This will allow for better data validation.
    - Parser(client input) -> Pydantic(validation) -> Form(user input) -> Pydantic(validation) -> SQL
- [x] Rebuild RSLNamer and fix circular imports
    - Should be used when coming in to parser and when leaving form. NO OTHER PLACES.
- [x] Change 'check_is_power_user' to decorator.
- [x] Drag and drop files into submission form area?
- [x] Get info for controls into their sample hitpicks.
- [x] Move submission-type specific parser functions into class methods in their respective models.
- [x] Improve function results reporting.
    - Maybe make it a list until it gets to the reporter?
- [x] Increase robustness of form parsers by adding custom procedures for each.
- [x] Rerun Kit integrity if extraction kit changed in the form.
- [x] Clean up db.functions.
- [x] Make kits easier to add.
- [x] Clean up & document code... again.
    - Including paring down the logging.debugs
    - Also including reducing number of functions in db.functions
- [x] Fix Tests... again.
- [x] Rebuild database
- [x] Provide more generic names for reagenttypes in kits and move specific names to reagents.
    - ex. Instead of "omega_e-z_96_disruptor_plate_c_plus" in reagent types, have "omega_plate" and have "omega_e-z_96_disruptor_plate_c_plus" in reagent name.
    - Maybe rename to "ReagentRoles"?
    - If I'm doing this, since the forms have a different layout for each submission type I should rewrite the parser to use the locations given in database... Which I should do anyway
- [x] Fix Wastewater/Artic double submission problem
- [x] Fix tests.
- [x] Reorganize wastewater artic parser.
- [x] Streamline addition of new kits by moving as much into DB as possible.
- [x] Large scale refactor (2023-07-24).
- [x] Make plate details from html, same as export.
- [x] Put in SN controls I guess.
- [x] Code clean-up and refactor (2023-07).
- [x] Migrate context settings to pydantic-settings model.
- [x] Insert column into reagent type to indicate if reagent is required for kit.
    - Needed to keep interchangeable bead plates from being forced into forms.
- [x] Migrate the parser.sub dictionary to pydantic models.
- [x] Move type_decider to metadata based method rather than excel map.
- [x] Solve bug for plate mapping when two samples of same name are in different rows.
    - Try importing "L:\Robotics Laboratory Support\Submissions\Wastewater\2023\2023-06-21\RSL-WW-20230621-1.xlsx" for example.
- [x] Improve plate mapping by using layout in submission forms rather than PCR.
- [x] Create a method for creation of hitpicking .csvs because of reasons that may or may not exist.
- [x] Create a method for commenting submissions.
- [x] Create barcode generator, because of reasons that may or may not exist.
- [x] Move bulk of functions from frontend.__init__ to frontend.functions as __init__ is getting bloated.
